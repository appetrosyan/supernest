<h1>Introduction</h1>

This is the documentation for the Python package `supernest`, the
general-purpose nested sampling accelerator.

While the project Wiki and the built-in documentation provide
sufficient API documentation, this documentation is meant as more of a
guided tour and a tutorial.

For best results, I highly recommend that you look at the interactive
documentation in the Notebooks folder, to give you some idea of what
the package is all about.

Here I shall go over the details and explain why things are done a
certain way.
