# Contributing. 

The main location for this project is gitlab, but it has a fully-functional mirror on github. 

Any issues open, are fair game to squash. 

## Coding style. 

I don't care for it. I won't give you a headache, because your code is not PEP8. 
If you need lines to be longer than 80 characters - go for it. If you use tabs -
go for it. 

My only request is that you use short, sensible names for variables. Naming 
things is hard, so if you're not sure, just ask.  I don't bite and I reply to emails.
