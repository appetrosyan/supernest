# Contributing


## Where the code lives

This project  historically lived on  GitLab.  Now it lives  on GitHub,
because  people  are scared  of  GitLab.   Both versions  are  updated
regularly.   Since  most contributions  come  from  GitHub and  GitHub
actions is free for public repositories, I shall encourage you to just
go to GitHub.  Changes made on GitLab will be propagated to GitHub and
vice versa,  but you'd be  making my life easier  if you just  go with
GitHub.

## What to do

If you have an issue to report, just use the GitHub issue tracker.

I try to keep things organised with tags, so feel free to add your own.

If you want to help, take up any issue and fix it.

If you  want me to  help you, message me  on Telegram, email,  or just
post a comment on the issues tagging me.  I don't bite, and you'd have
to try really hard to get me to act out.

## Coding style

I don't care for it. I won't give you a headache, because your code is
not PEP8.  If you need lines to  be longer than 80 characters - go for
it. If  you use tabs  - go  for it.

If there are problems that need  fixing, I'll tell you about them, but
more often than not, your code is  either fine, or it'd take me longer
to explain how to fix it, than to fix it.
